Just me playing around with functions, getting in them reps.

Let’s write some functions! Write these in the script tag of a skeleton HTML file. If you’ve forgotten how to set it up, review the instructions from Fundamentals Part 1.

For now, just write each function and test the output with console.log.

    Write a function called add7 that takes one number and returns that number + 7.
    Write a function called multiply that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.
    Write a function called capitalize that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.
    Write a function called lastLetter that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
        lastLetter("abcd") should return "d"
